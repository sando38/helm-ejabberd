## Unreleased
### Added
- Extend CI to include cluster chaos, e.g. pod kills, failures, etc., processone
  `rtb` to test XMPP connections as well as scaling up and down.
- Use kubernetes leases to elect an ejabberd leading pod for clustering. This
  improves the robustness of the helm chart overall. The elector is enabled at
  default.

### Changed
- Move image run scripts into the chart templates. This enables admins to easier
  exchange the container image.

### Fixed
- Fix parsing `host` values.

### Removed
- Remove the possibility to change the TCP healthcheck port. Healthchecks are
  now performed with a custom healthcheck script. You still can define custom
  healthchecks within the `values.yml` file.
